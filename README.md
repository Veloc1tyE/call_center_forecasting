# call_center_forecasting
Deep RL Agent that can learn resource allocation for call-centers

This agent learns through exploring its environment, and has a very natural error signal 
- the proportion of customers who are not services within the desired timefram

It implements Policy-Gradient optimisation and shows itself to be very effective at optimising underperforming systems
